### Project Overview 🔍
**Jorge’s Café** is a growing food business offering pastries, meals, and beverages across multiple branches in Batangas. Despite its expansion, the café continues to rely on manual methods for recording sales, tracking inventory, and processing orders. These traditional practices—such as using Excel sheets, handwritten notes, and Viber messages—often lead to inaccurate records, delays, and communication gaps between staff and management. The lack of a centralized digital system also limits the café’s ability to monitor stock levels, validate payments, and generate summarized operational reports.

To address these operational challenges, the project introduces SanServe-All, a centralized web-based system designed to automate inventory tracking, streamline order processing, and organize sales documentation. The platform features real-time stock monitoring, automated ingredient deduction, product availability updates, and receipt-based payment verification to minimize errors and improve workflow efficiency. By integrating these essential functions into a single accessible system, SanServe-All enhances staff coordination and supports a more reliable, modernized, and scalable operational structure for Jorge’s Café.

### Application of System Design 🏗️
In developing SanServe-All, various system design principles and methodologies were applied to ensure that the platform is efficient, reliable, and aligned with the operational needs of Jorge’s Café. These design concepts guided how the system’s components were structured, how data flows between processes, and how users interact with the platform.

- **Modular Design Architecture** 🧩  
  SanServe-All is divided into functional modules such as `Inventory Management`, `Order Processing`, `Receipt Verification`, and `Reporting`.  
  Each module performs specific tasks while remaining connected to a centralized database.  
  This modular approach ensures `easier maintenance`, `scalability`, and `clear separation of responsibilities`.

- **Data Flow Diagrams (DFD)** 📊  
  DFDs were used to map how data moves across the system. For example, when a customer places an order, the system flows through processes like `order validation`, `inventory deduction`, and `receipt submission`.  
  `DFD Levels 0 and 1` help break down the workflow, ensuring that each process is logically arranged and avoids bottlenecks.

- **Entity–Relationship Diagram (ERD)** 🗂️  
  The ERD defines the database structure, showing how tables such as `Products`, `Ingredients`, `Orders`, `Receipts`, and `Users` relate to each other.  
  This ensures that `inventory quantities`, `ingredient usage`, and `order transactions` remain organized and accurately linked.

- **Use Case Modeling** 🎭  
  Use Case Diagrams illustrate how different users interact with the system. Customers can `place orders` and `upload receipts`, while staff can `verify payments` and `update inventory`.  
  These diagrams guided the development of each feature based on real café workflows.

- **User-Centered Interface Design** 🖥️  
  Considering that many café employees are non–tech-savvy, the interface was designed to be `simple` and `intuitive`.  
  `Clear navigation`, `real-time notifications`, and `automated prompts` help prevent errors and make the system easy to use.

- **Real-Time Processing and Notifications** 🔔  
  System design principles were applied to enable instant updates—such as `notifying staff of new orders` and `automatically adjusting stock levels`.  
  This real-time workflow helps ensure `timely preparation` and minimizes `stock discrepancies`.

- **Centralized Database Design** 🗄️  
  A structured database allows all users to access `consistent information`. `Inventory levels`, `order details`, `ingredient usage`, and `receipt submissions` are stored in one place, supporting `accurate reporting` and `efficient decision-making`.

**SanServe-All** integrates core modules—such as inventory management, order processing, receipt verification, and reporting—into a cohesive system architecture that ensures seamless communication through a centralized database and well-defined interfaces. Utilizing a client-server model and layered architecture, the system supports scalability, data consistency, and real-time synchronization, enabling efficient and reliable operations for Jorge’s Café. This integration directly aligns with **Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth** by automating workflows, reducing operational errors, and enhancing employee productivity through real-time notifications and simplified processes. Additionally, SanServe-All facilitates informed decision-making with comprehensive sales and inventory reports, empowering the café to grow sustainably while maintaining quality service and efficient resource use in support of sustained and inclusive economic growth.

### Running the System 👩‍💻
**1. Frontend Layer (User Interface)** - This is the part users see on their browser. It is written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Responsible Files:
- `main.html` – Main landing page
- `orderonline.html` – Customer ordering page
- `dashboard.php` – Admin interface UI
- `login.php / customer_login.php`– Login interfaces
- `main.css, login.css, orderonline.css, dashboard.css` – Styling
- `main.js, login.js, orderonline.js, dashboard.js` – Behavior and dynamic actions

**What this layer handles:**
- Buttons and navigation
- Cart logic using `localStorage`
- Order form inputs
- Product display
- Sidebar navigation (dashboard)
- Login form behavior
- Checkout modal
- Animations and notifications

**2. Backend Layer (PHP Logic)**
This layer controls:
- Login authentication
- Session handling
- Order validation
- Admin access
- Database queries
  
**Backend Responsibilities:**
- Verifies credentials
- Maintains login sessions
- Protects pages
- Processes order data
- Controls who can access dashboard
- Saves data to MySQL

**3. Data Layer (MySQL Database)** - This is where all records should exist:
- Users
- Orders
- Products
- Inventory
- Payments

**The system expects:**
- A MySQL database connected through PHP
- Tables for users, orders, products, and stock

**URL MAP (Exact Page Access Guide)**
Use this assuming your project folder is: `C:\xampp\htdocs\jorgescafe\`

## 3. Log In
Once the pages load:

- **Customers** log in to order, browse the menu, add items to cart, choose pickup/dine-in, and upload receipts.
- **Admins/Staff** log in to view sales, manage menu items, check inventory, update stocks, manage recipes, and monitor orders.

All features appear automatically after logging in.

---

## 4. Using the System
The system is already connected to XAMPP, so:

- Orders update inventory
- Sales records update automatically
- Menu and recipe changes reflect instantly
- Admin dashboard content loads in real time

No additional installation or setup is needed — just log in and use the features.

---

## 5. Closing the System
When finished:

1. Log out of your account  
2. Close your browser  
3. Go back to **XAMPP**  
4. Click **Stop** on:
   - Apache  
   - MySQL  

This fully shuts down the system.
